      <h4> <i>~we all saw this coming</i>
      </h4>
<p>
  Elliott is a character from the successful indie video game, Stardew Valley, made by Concerned Ape. 
  He is a writer who lives in the cabin on the beach and happend to move to the valley a year befor the farmer. <br>
  <br>In my opinion, the best way to describe him is as <i>floppy</i>.
      </p>
<p>
  In Stardew Valley all of the NPCs have loved and liked gifts, these are items that you can give the character and gain friendship with them.
      </p> 
      <p><strong>Elliott's favorite gifts are:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><u>Lobster</u> <span style="color: grey">which can be gotten from crabpotts in the beach</span></li>
     <li><u>Squid Ink</u> <span style="color: grey">which are dropped by Squid Kids on floors 91-119 of the mines</span></li>
      <li><u>Crab Cakes</u></li>
      <li><u>Duck Feathers</u> <span style="color: grey">which are produced by ducks, after you get the Big Coop upgrade</span></li>
      <li><u>Pomogranate</u> <span style="color: grey">which grow on pomogranate trees during Fall</span></li>
        <li><u>Tom Kha Soup</u></li>
      </ul>
  <p>
    <small><i>Elliott's birthday is on Fall 5th. Gifts given on a characters birthday are worth three times more friendship.</i></small>
